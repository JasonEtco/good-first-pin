<h3 align="center">[WIP] Good First Pin [bot]</h3>
<p align="center">A GitHub App built with <a href="https://github.com/probot/probot">Probot</a> that rotates pinned issues based on <kbd>Good First Issue</kbd> labels<p>

## Usage

:soon:

## How it works

Currently (as of the first commit), the app listens for `issues.labeled` events (when a label was added to an issue). If that label is a <kbd>Good First Issue</kbd> label, the app pins that issue.

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run typescript
npm run build

# Run the bot
npm start
```
